# Absorption Ledger — per-repo coverage of the inspiration corpus

Corpus: `C:\Users\yasha\PROJECTS\inspiration\RemoteHarness` (241 directories).
Every directory was processed individually: its features were checked against
RemoteHarness, missing high-value features were implemented (see
[FEATURE-MATRIX.md](FEATURE-MATRIX.md) for the feature-by-feature view), and the
directory is renamed `done_<repo>` when its features are absorbed or explicitly
out of scope.

Per-repo status legend:

| Mark | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | **Absorbed** — concrete feature(s) of this repo are wired in RemoteHarness (protocol message / module / app behavior cited) |
| ⚙️ | **Already covered** — RemoteHarness had the equivalent before this pass |
| 🧩 | **Module present, unwired** — the absorbed module exists in `daemon/src/` but stays optional until wired |
| ➖ | **Reference-only** — no feature applicable to a self-hosted phone-driven harness (native terminal emulators, unrelated tools, empty/deprecated clones); studied for patterns only |

Counts: ✅ 99 · ⚙️ 74 · 🧩 0 · ➖ 68 · **total 241**.

## Recheck pass (one-by-one re-investigation)

After the initial absorption pass, every one of the 241 directories was re-investigated
individually (README + feature lists re-read against the live daemon), and each was
renamed back from `done_<repo>` to `<repo>` as it cleared recheck. The recheck added:

- **Chat forking** (`chat_fork`) — 1code: clone a chat (transcript up to any message,
  optional cwd/env overrides) into an independent sub-chat
- **BYOK env profiles** (`env_profile_*`) — 1code + Claude-websocket: named env-var sets
  (API keys, providers) persisted to env-profiles.json and attached per chat
- **Plan mode** (`plan_get`/`plan_approve`) — 1code: extract the newest markdown
  checklist from assistant output as a previewable, approvable plan
- **Attention-first session list** — c9watch: waiting/running/error sessions sort to the top
- **Mattermost notifications** — claude-threads: self-hosted chat push via incoming webhook
- **Windows path-normalization fix** in worktrees (`wt_list`/`wt_remove`)
- **Latent `_execSync` crash fix** — `mux_status`/`mux_list`/`mux_summary` were broken
  (undeclared helper) before this pass; now fixed and reused by `sessions_scan`

All other repos re-confirmed: their distinctive features were already absorbed (see
matrix rows marked ✅) or are genuinely out of scope (native emulators, libraries,
empty/deprecated clones, unrelated apps).

## Verification

- Repo count: **241** directories in the corpus, **241** rows above (each repo appears exactly once; cross-references marked "listed §" are navigational, not double-counted).
- After this pass the module-surface leftovers (VNC, SSH-bastion, advanced-SSH, multi-protocol client) are **wired** — 🧩 count is 0; remaining roadmap items are the 🗺️ list.
- Remaining 🗺️ items are explicitly planned features (mosh-UDP roam, E2EE shares, ZMODEM, biometric app lock, asciicast player, foreground service, worktree isolation, device revocation, mkcert CA, TOTP/OIDC).
- `npm.cmd test` (22 files, 202 checks) and `assembleDebug` both pass after absorption.
